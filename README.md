# jepsen.Big-O

A Clojure library designed to perform linearizable test for Big-O solutions.

## Usage

### To run test suite

```agsl
cd docker
bash bin/up  --dev -d
bash bin/console
// Use this command for quick feedback
lein run test --concurrency 10 --test-limit 5
// Use this command only when the final testing in needed
lein run test --concurrency 100 --test-limit 60 --test-count 10
```

### To check the run histories

* you can either check `/store` folder for test-run related logs and details.
  * Logs from the database will also be accessible under nodes folder(n1, n2, n3)
* You can serve the results as a website and access the details through UI
```agsl
  cd docker
  bash bin/console
  lein run serve
  // Open a new terminal
  cd docker
  bash bin/web
          
```

### To stop/remove the containers
```agsl
cd docker
bash bin/stop-all.sh
// Or.
bash bin/remove-all.sh
```

### To run your solution against the test suite

* I have compiled my mock solution and added the binary to the nodes docker (docker/node/Dockerfile)
* Update utils.clj with your binary name.
* If there are any command line arguments needed, those can be added here (bigo/db.clj:22)


**Test suite would print the below statement when the test succeed**
